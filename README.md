# Turtle-Crossing

It's a infinite loop of a turtle trying to cross a road full of cars.

I did it using the turtle module in pyhton.

It was tricky figuring out how the cars would swanp. 
At the end i used the a long init function to swapn a number of cars and recycle them to the start.

The swapn area can be changed as well as the number of cars that will be swapned.

Had fun using the turltle module.

P.S. its a joke...
